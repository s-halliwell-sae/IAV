Instructions:
Do not change any of the scripts in the "Editor" folder, they need to be there so the Editor GUI shows up.

create an empty game object in scene (this should be static, unless you plan to move the spline around the scene)
place the "BezierSpline" script on the empty game object


Bezier Spline:
You can set the curve to loop, though I suggest waiting until you have added enough curves to the spline, as looping before adding curves will cluster them all at the start position

You can click the add curve button to add another point the line, and its two control points surroundding it.

Select the white points to position them, and choose its mode:
Free: move the current node without effecting its surrounding nodes (white)
Mirrored: opposite node of main node mirrors movement and rotation (cyan)
Aligned: opposite node of main node morrors rotation, but not movement (yellow)

When a point is selected, you can move the point around in space using the position transform tool that appears
You can also set the position using the vector3 co-ordinates box that appears in the component area


to move an object along the curve, add the SplineWalker script to an object

Spline Walker:
Drop an existing object with the BezierSpline component attached to it into the Spline section
Set the duration in seconds that you wish the object to take to complete the spline path
Look forward rotates the object to face towards the direction of movement

There are three modes of movement: once, loop and ping pong
Once: moves from the begining of the path to the end, and stops there
Loop: at the end of the path, continues immediately at the beginning of the path. If the path is not looped, the walker teleports to the beginning.
Ping Pong: at the end of the path, the object moves backwards along the path, but does not rotate to face direction.

You can also populate the path of the spline using Spline Decorator. Create an empty game object and add the spline decorator script.

Spline Decorator:
add a game object with the Bezier Spline component attached to it to the Spline section

Frequency is the amount of objects that will be instantiated per curve section (the main points that the curve intersects)
Look forward causes the objects to face the movement direction of the path
The items array requires you place prefabs into it to give it a pool to spawn from. Objects are iterated through sequentially,
so placing a cube, sphere and then capsule would have that pattern repeated throughout the path, despite where the points in the path are
